Project Description

Emergency City Simulation is a C# console-based simulation game where you act as the city's emergency dispatcher!
Your job is to assign the correct emergency unit to random incidents such as:

Crime
Fire
Medical Emergency
Hazardous Material Spill
Flood
Earthquake
Building Collapse
You can play in:

Manual Mode: You choose which unit should respond.
Automatic Mode: The system automatically dispatches the correct unit.
Every incident has a random location (Downtown, Airport, Suburbs, etc.) and a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) that affects your score.
Respond correctly to earn points â€” wrong choices will lose you points!
